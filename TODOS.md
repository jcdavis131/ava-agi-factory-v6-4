# TODOS — Continuous Pipeline

Foreman updates after every dispatch and verification. A task is `done` only when the foreman has
**run its acceptance command and seen it pass** — never on a worker's word.

---

## Stage 0 — Host prep ✅
- [x] **T0.1** Identify the 1.8GB GPU process — **NOT stray**: it is `vector-hoops/pipeline/sweep_v5.py --epochs 40 --seeds 7,13,21 --device cuda --resume`, a live sweep. Left running. nano/mini (~5-7GB) coexist; base1b needs it gone.
- [x] **T0.2** `docker builder prune -a` → **reclaimed 25.06GB** (est. was 14GB). Volumes untouched.
- [x] **T0.3** Re-measure. C: shows 26.8GB free; Docker freed 25GB *inside* its 45GB ext4 VHDX, which it reuses before growing. Effective headroom ≈ 50GB. `image prune` not needed.
- [x] **T0.4** `.wslconfig` written (`memory=10GB`, `processors=24`, `swap=8GB`, `sparseVhd=true`). ⚠️ Needs `wsl --shutdown` + Docker Desktop restart to apply — **deferred, requires your OK** (stops all distros).
- [x] **T0.5** Volumes `ava_{raw,packed,ckpt,state,reports}` created **and chowned to uid 1000** (docker creates them root-owned; the manifest could not create its DB).

## Stage 1 — Docker infrastructure ✅
- [x] **T1.1** 🟦 `docker/Dockerfile.cpu` — *accept:* streams 2 TinyStories rows in-container ✅
- [x] **T1.2** 🟦 `docker/Dockerfile.gpu` — based on `python:3.11-slim` + cu124 wheels (not `nvidia/cuda:*-runtime`: the wheels vendor their own CUDA libs, saving ~5GB). *accept:* `torch.cuda.is_available()` + bf16 matmul on the 4080 ✅
- [x] **T1.3** 🟦 `docker-compose.yml` (collector×4, curator×6, trainer, server, janitor; named volumes; GPU reservations) — *accept:* `docker compose config` valid ✅
- [x] **T1.4** 🟦 `Makefile`, `.dockerignore`, `.env.example`, `.gitattributes` (CRLF breaks make recipes and shebangs in Linux containers) ✅

## Stage 2 — Manifest + shard flow ✅
- [x] **T2.1** 🟪 `ava/pipeline/manifest.py` — WAL SQLite, `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` atomic claims, leases + requeue, state-machine guards, tokenizer freeze gate, resumable cursors, structural val/test protection
- [x] **T2.2** 🟪 `ava/pipeline/flow.py` — backpressure predicates, `DATA_STARVED`, phase prefetch
- [x] **T2.3** 🟦 `configs/pipeline.yaml` — watermarks sized for this host
- [x] *accept:* **28 tests** — 12 threads + 4 processes over 1000 shards: zero double-claims, zero lost shards. **Negative control:** downgrading to `BEGIN DEFERRED` makes it fail, so the test is not vacuous ✅

## Stage 3 — Collector ✅
- [x] **T3.1** 🟪 `ava/pipeline/collector.py` — HF streaming, backoff+jitter, resumable cursors, 256MB zstd shards, atomic publish (`.tmp`→fsync→`os.replace`→register), backpressure-aware. *accept:* 15 offline tests ✅ + **live**: streamed 500 TinyStories docs, restarted, resumed at cursor 500 with no duplicate doc_ids ✅
- [x] **T3.3** 🟦 `configs/sources.yaml` — 11 sources, all verified `200` + `gated:false` against the HF API. `bigcode/the-stack-smol` excluded (`gated:"auto"`). Per-phase weights sum to 1.0 (asserted)
- [x] **T3.2** 🟦 `ava/datagen/*` — logic / math / encyclopedia / code / chat_safety. 35 tests that check **content**: an independent proof checker re-derives each natural-deduction proof; every math answer is recomputed; every code snippet is re-exec'd; spider→8 / ant→6 / France→Paris never contradicted with ≥40 paraphrases each. Byte-deterministic.
- [x] **T3.4** 👷 **Reconciled.** Deleted the collector's inline toy generators (a stub logic doc, a hardcoded refusal) in favour of `ava/datagen`. Three bugs surfaced: the registry was **relabelling** generator output (needle docs were phase-1 arithmetic stamped phase-4); needle actually lives in `EncyclopediaGenerator`, not `MathGenerator`; and cursors keyed by source alone would make a multi-phase generator resume into the wrong subsequence (now per `(source, phase)`). `synth_code` had no registry entry at all. *accept:* cpu 97 / gpu 56 ✅ + live shard written and inspected ✅

## Stage 4 — Curator ✅
- [x] **T4.1** 🟪 `clean.py` — normalize / is_english / Gopher heuristics / edu_score / PII scrub (conservative: leaves `0xDEADBEEF`, bare digit runs)
- [x] **T4.2** 🟪 `dedup.py` — sha256 exact + MinHash LSH (9×13 bands @ 0.8) in its own WAL DB; `add_if_new` is check-and-insert in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` for cross-replica safety
- [x] **T4.3** 🟪 `decontaminate.py` — 13-gram + short-phrase floor (≥5 words). **Both directions tested**: every eval prompt is removed; "Spiders possess eight legs." is kept
- [x] **T4.4** 🟪 `split.py` — `bucket(sha1(doc_id))`, order-invariant, rerun-stable
- [x] **T4.5** 🟪 `pack.py` — uint16 `.bin` + `.idx.json`, vocab≤65535 asserted, frozen-tokenizer gate
- [x] **T4.6** 🟦 `curator.py` service loop; SIGTERM-graceful; `fail()` never crashes the container
- [x] *accept:* 19 curator tests, **62/62 suite** ✅
- [x] **Deviation accepted:** `complete()` **before** deleting raw. Spec said the reverse; the worker was right — deleting first then crashing would requeue a row whose raw file is gone, losing data. Worst case now is an inert orphaned file.

## Stage 5 — Tokenizer bootstrap + throughput gate 🟡
- [x] **T5.1** 🟦 Bootstrap corpus collected across phases 0/1/2/5 (synthetic + tinystories)
- [x] **T5.2** 🟦 `ava/tokenizer.py` — byte-level BPE, specials pinned to ids 0–5, atomic save, sha256 → manifest. **Live:** nano 8192-vocab trained on the real corpus, `roundtrip=ok chars/token=3.28`, frozen as `8f609ef4b82e`. 11 tests
- [x] **T5.3** 👷 **Data plane proven end-to-end:** collector → curator → 16 PACKED shards, 0 RAW, 0 FAILED, `raw_bytes=0` (raw deleted after packing). 373,438 tokens across train/val/test; packed uint16 decodes back to the source text
- [x] **T5.4** 🟦 `scripts/bench_pipeline.py` — *accept:* curation tok/s ≥ 3× trainer tok/s. **Measured (nano, host CUDA):** collector ~438k tok/s, curator **62.4k tok/s**, trainer **10.1k tok/s**, ratio **6.15×** → GATE PASS. JSON: `reports/bench_pipeline.json`

### Bugs found by running it (not by reading it)
- **`pack.py` crashed on every HF shard** (`TypeError: TextInputSequence must be str`): `d.get("concept", "")` returns `None` for an explicit JSON null, and only synthetic docs carry a concept.
- Worse, the fallback tagged untagged docs with `<|endofdoc|>`. HF is most of the corpus, so the reportability loss would have learned to "report" end-of-document. Untagged docs now carry `UNTAGGED_CONCEPT = -1` and `ava/jlosses.py` masks them out of the report loss.
- `decode()` stripped `<|user|>`/`<|assistant|>`, which are real tokens in the chat corpus, not decoration. `skip_special` is now explicit: default on for serving, off for round-trip fidelity.

## Stage 6 — Model + trainer ✅
- [x] **T6.1** 🟪 Model fixes — **the big one.** *accept:* 28 tests ✅
  - [x] Causal mask (SDPA). Bare transformer stack now measures **exactly 0.0** logit change at positions < t
  - [x] **J-Space was non-causal**: it mean-pooled the whole sequence and broadcast it everywhere (measured leak ~0.20). Now **chunk-recurrent** — broadcast into chunk *c* comes only from chunks < *c*
  - [x] `rotate_half` half-split (was interleaved, disagreeing with cos/sin → garbage rotation)
  - [x] `_prev_workspaces` detach + batch guard (backward-through-freed-graph on step 2)
  - [x] `JacobianLens.top_concepts` implemented (was dead → `verbalizable_mass` constant 0.06)
  - [x] Verbalizer tied to lm_head (was allocating 2×[V,D] per workspace, discarding one)
  - [x] **Initialization** wired: init loss 196 → **9.07** vs ln(8192)=9.011. Overfits one batch to 0.05/30 steps
  - [x] GQA + SwiGLU + gradient checkpointing (config-gated, causality-tested)
  - [x] Param counts corrected: nano 13.8M, mini 171.3M (was 270M — `tie_verbalizer` must stay true), base1b **1409M** (spec said 1.17B)
- [x] **T6.2** 🟪 `ava/jlosses.py` — combined objective with blueprint weights
- [x] **T6.3** 🟪 `ava/data.py` — `StreamingShardSampler`: memmapped shards, `task_type`-pure batches, blocks with `DATA_STARVED` not a crash, hands its claim back on exit. 8 tests
- [x] **T6.4** 🟪 `ava/train.py` — WSD, phase manager + RoPE transitions, grad-accum, bf16 autocast, AdamW8bit, checkpoint/`--resume`, `metrics.jsonl`, `--branch chat --init` with a real `load_state_dict`. 7 tests
- [x] **NANO SMOKE PASSED** on the RTX 4080: `lm 9.053 → 3.400` in 30 steps at **~18–20k tok/s**, 13.79M params, checkpoint written, `--resume` verified (run A ends step 10 @ 7.605 → run B resumes and reaches step 20 @ 5.84, matching the single-run 5.947 within data-order variance)

### Bugs found by running it (again, not by reading it)
- **The sampler starved the trainer forever.** It refused to let a window straddle a document; the synthetic corpus has a **median doc of ~100 tokens**, so at `seq_len=256` phases 1 and 5 produced *zero* windows. Docs are now concatenated with `<|endofdoc|>` separators — but only within one `task_type`, so the routing-KL target stays well defined.
- **`modulation` was a loss term that could never fire.** It computed `cos(bc, bc.detach())` against `cos(0, bc)`; `cos(x,x) ≡ 1`, so the hinge was `relu(0.5 − 1.0) = 0` for every input that has ever existed. Now compares `cos(fused+bc, bc)` vs `cos(fused, bc)` and is measurably decreasing (0.4965 → 0.4704 over 30 steps).
- **`selectivity` was gameable and invisible**: raw slot variance can be minimized by shrinking every activation, and at ~2.6e-7 it was being logged as `0.0` by `round(v, 5)`. Now scale-normalized and logged to 4 significant figures.
- **The trainer leaked its shard lease on every exit.** Four runs locked all 936k phase-0 tokens in `CLAIMED_TRAIN`, and the next run starved on data it already owned. Added `Manifest.release_claim()` — a clean handback that, unlike `fail()`, does **not** burn an attempt (three ordinary restarts would otherwise have parked a good shard in `FAILED`).

> `--resume` is **loss-continuous, not bit-exact**. Model/optimizer/step/phase/RNG restore exactly, but the shard set is live, so data order cannot be reproduced. Bit-exactness needs an as-of manifest watermark (T10.5).
- [x] **T6.5** 🟦 `ava/pipeline/janitor.py` — watermarks, delete CONSUMED (never val/test), ckpt rotation ✅

## Stage 7 — Real evaluation harness ✅
- [x] **T7.1** 🟪 `evals/perplexity.py` — val/test PPL on heldout bins (`scripts/build_eval_data.py` builds tokenizer + heldout) ✅
- [x] **T7.2** 🟪 `evals/probes.py` + `evals/probe_items/*.jsonl` (200 items/set, seed 1234) ✅
- [x] **T7.3** 🟪 `evals/jspace_tests.py` + `evals/interventions.py` — real `_emit` hooks; `concept_vector` uses `concept_token()` fallback for multi-piece BPE (deviation from spec 06 single-token assert) ✅
- [x] **T7.4** 🟪 `evals/needle.py` — native 1024 + YaRN 2048 pass-key retrieval ✅
- [x] **T7.5** 🟪 `evals/run_harness.py` → `reports/branch_eval_results_real.json` + `REPORT_REAL.md`. *accept:* eval tests **6 passed**; harness smoke **37–56s** wall; full suite **120 cpu + 89 gpu** ✅

## Stage 8 — Live serving
- [x] **T8.1** 🟪 `ava/serve_engine.py` — real `generate` / `inspect` / `intervene` (+ `runs/serve_audit.jsonl`) ✅
- [x] **T8.2** 🟪 `server.py` — fix `from typing import Optional` (import-time `NameError`), pydantic-v2 `Field(alias="from")`, wire to engine, keep the 403 gate, add `/health` `/generate` `/report` ✅
- [x] **T8.3** 🟪 Hot-reload `ckpt/latest` — experiment against the model *while it trains* ✅
- [x] **T8.4** 🟦 `scripts/make_report.py` → self-contained `reports/index.html` (no CDN). *accept:* 18040 bytes; `cdn|https://fonts` count 0; also writes `report_real.html`
- [x] **T8.5** 🟦 `scripts/smoke_live.sh` (+ `smoke_live_checks.py`, root `Dockerfile`/`run.sh`) — *accept (partial):* `AVA_SMOKE_DRY_RUN=1` → **SMOKE PASS** (health/generate/inspect/intervene-403/eval_branch/report/intervene-write via ASGI fake engine); missing ckpt → clear **SMOKE FAIL ckpt** (non-zero). **Full live** `AVA_CKPT=runs/chat/ava_nano_chat.pt bash scripts/smoke_live.sh` **deferred to T9.1** (ckpt absent). Also: minimal Stage-8 `Dockerfile` + `run.sh` (compose remains primary).

## Stage 9 — Scale ladder
- [ ] **T9.1** 👷 nano smoke: all five services, ~10 min. Gate = *the loop works*
- [ ] **T9.2** 👷 mini (171M, ~2.5B tokens, 3–5 days). Watch `hl_est → target`, `route_probs` separating by `task_type`, val PPL ↓. Serve throughout
- [ ] **T9.3** 👷 **GO/NO-GO** for base1b, on mini's `reports/eval_real.json`. Also decide the base1b trim: 1409M × (bf16 weights + grads + AdamW8bit) = 8.4GB before activations, against ~11.6GB. Options: drop `n_fusion_layers` 28→24 (−92M), or narrow the workspaces
- [ ] **T9.4** 👷 base1b milestones M1 2B → M2 10B → M3 30B+
- [ ] **T9.5** 👷 Branch fine-tunes (code/math/chat) from any stable checkpoint

## Stage 10 — Continuous supply, streaming ingestion & storage at scale (cross-cutting; underpins Stages 6–9)
The primitives already exist — backpressure + `phase_next` prefetch + `DATA_STARVED` (`flow.py`, T2.2),
`StreamingShardSampler` (T6.3), janitor watermarks (T8.5). This stage turns them into a **curriculum-aware,
stay-ahead control loop** over **bounded memory** feeding a **bounded, versioned, ever-growing store**.
Nothing here re-implements Stage 2/4; it is the governor, the reproducible view, and the retention policy on top.

- [ ] **T10.1** 🟪 `ava/pipeline/pacer.py` — **curriculum pacing controller.** Reads the trainer's live phase + consumption rate from the manifest and holds a target **lead buffer** of PACKED tokens per phase (≥ `lead_steps × global_batch_tokens`, for `phase_current` **and** `phase_next`), continuously reweighting collector + datagen effort toward the phase the trainer will reach next. A setpoint on runway, not the existing on/off backpressure. *accept:* a simulated trainer draining P0→P5 at varying tok/s never sees `DATA_STARVED` > a few s at any transition; per-phase runway stays in `[lead, high-water]` across a replayed trace. Deps: T2.2, T6.3.
- [ ] **T10.2** 🟪 **Infinite-generator governor** — `ava/datagen/*` emit unbounded data; gate production per `(source, phase)` on that phase's runway *deficit* so P0 can't overproduce and evict P5's disk budget. Deterministic resume (extends the per-`(source,phase)` cursor from T3.4). *accept:* under a tight disk cap all six phases still reach their lead target, no phase starves another, byte-deterministic across restart. Deps: T3.2, T3.4, T10.1.
- [ ] **T10.3** 🟪 **Bounded-memory streaming ingestion** — trainer/curator RSS stays flat regardless of corpus size: `np.memmap` the uint16 `.bin` (no full-shard loads), fixed-size prefetch queues across claim→decompress→collate, a bounded shuffle buffer (shard-shuffle + intra-buffer), pinned-memory + async H2D double-buffering to overlap load with compute, and no-padding sequence packing at each phase's seq-len. Extends T6.3. *accept:* trainer RSS bounded across a 100k-step run over a corpus ≥ 50× RAM; GPU util ≥ target at prefetch depth 2; **zero** pad tokens in `task_type`-pure batches. Deps: T6.3, T4.5.
- [ ] **T10.4** 🟪 **Live throughput invariant** (makes T5.4 continuous) — `curation_tok/s ≥ trainer_tok/s` **and** `production_tok/s ≥ trainer_tok/s` enforced as a *running* gauge; the pacer scales curator/collector replicas (compose) or trips backpressure when the ratio dips. *accept:* an injected trainer speedup auto-triggers more curator concurrency and the ratio recovers within N min. Deps: T5.4, T10.1.
- [ ] **T10.5** 🟪 **Reproducible dataset view / as-of watermark** — an expanding store makes "resume" ambiguous. Pin each run to a manifest **watermark** (monotonic shard-registration id) so resume and re-run see a deterministic, replayable data order; record `watermark + tokenizer_hash + curriculum_weights` in the checkpoint. *accept:* kill+resume at step K reads the identical next-shard sequence bit-for-bit; a fresh run at the same watermark+seed reproduces `metrics.jsonl` order. Deps: T2.1, T6.4.
- [ ] **T10.6** 🟪 **Frozen eval snapshots vs. growing train** — val/test buckets grow too as generation continues; freeze a **named val/test snapshot** (shard-id set) per scale rung so PPL/probe numbers are comparable across M1→M2→M3 while train keeps expanding. Structural val/test protection (T2.1) already prevents leakage; this adds comparability. *accept:* two milestones evaluate on byte-identical val/test token streams; new data never silently changes a past milestone's eval set. Deps: T2.1, T7.1.
- [ ] **T10.7** 🟪 **Unique-token accounting + replay policy** — define epoch semantics under single-pass delete-after-consume when a phase's *unique* supply < what the trainer needs (likely for base1b's ~20B). Track unique-tokens-seen per phase via the dedup DB (T4.2); on exhaustion either block for fresh collection or do **controlled** replay with a re-shuffle and a logged `replay_epoch` — never silent back-to-back re-showing of the same synthetic docs (memorization). *accept:* a phase forced into replay shows re-shuffled order + `replay_epoch`, and dedup confirms no doc repeats within window W. Deps: T4.2, T10.1.
- [ ] **T10.8** 🟦 **Shard compaction + addressable index** — many small shards hurt open/seek and manifest bloat; a compactor merges undersized PACKED shards per `(phase, split, seq_len)` and maintains a compact index so any `(phase, task_type, split)` subset is directly addressable without a full scan. Respects the frozen-tokenizer + val/test gates. *accept:* post-compaction shard count ↓, mean shard ≈ target size, sampler reads an unchanged token stream (sha256 of concatenated tokens per subset stable). Deps: T4.5, T2.1.
- [ ] **T10.9** 🟦 **Storage retention + disk high-water eviction** — on a single 28GB drive an ever-growing corpus needs more than delete-CONSUMED: high-water eviction that sheds the *least-curriculum-useful* RAW/PACKED first (over-supplied phases, oldest, lowest `edu_score`), **never** val/test, **never** a phase under its lead target. Extends the janitor (T8.5). *accept:* under a synthetic disk-fill, eviction keeps free-disk in band and never drops a phase below lead; no val/test byte ever deleted. Deps: T8.5, T10.1.
- [ ] **T10.10** 🟦 **Supply observability** — `metrics.jsonl` + `/report` expose per-phase runway (steps & tokens), lead/lag vs setpoint, `DATA_STARVED` counters, production/curation/train tok/s + ratios, unique-tokens-per-phase, disk headroom, and `replay_epoch`s. This is how a human confirms "steady state = success" (PLAN.md). *accept:* a nano smoke shows all six phases' runway live; a forced starvation is visible within one scrape interval. Deps: T8.4, T10.1.

## Docs
- [x] `PLAN.md`, `TODOS.md`, `ORCHESTRATION.md` rewritten for the continuous pipeline
- [ ] `specs/` refresh — `specs/04` is still accurate; `specs/08` param math needs the J-Space correction
- [x] `specs/10_continuous_supply.md` — contract for Stage 10 (pacer setpoints, infinite-generator governor, bounded-memory streaming, as-of watermark, frozen eval snapshots, replay policy, compaction, curriculum-aware eviction, observability). Grounded in the real `Manifest`/`FlowConfig` API; adds `pacing`/`reproducibility`/`storage`/`replay` config blocks and a `Manifest.claim(max_rowid=...)` extension. Each task carries an acceptance command with a negative control.

## Open risks
1. **base1b VRAM.** 1409M is 20% over spec. Not yet proven to fit. Decided at T9.3.
2. **`trust_remote_code` sources.** `proof-pile-2` and `github-code` fetch a loader script from HF at runtime; an upstream change can break collection mid-run.
3. **Only `tinystories` (HF) and `synth_logic` (synthetic) were live-run.** The other 5 HF sources are API-verified but not yet pulled. `fineweb-edu`'s `score` field name is taken from the spec, not observed.
4. **Decontamination coupling.** `evals/eval_sets.py` and `ava/datagen/encyclopedia.py` must keep their phrasings distinct; verbatim matching is what separates prompt-form from fact.
5. **`.wslconfig` not applied** — needs `wsl --shutdown`.
6. **Supply may not outrun the GPU at base1b** (~100M tok/day). If `production_tok/s < trainer_tok/s`, T10.7 replay engages; unmitigated it is silent overfitting. This is *the* risk of the continuous premise — measured, not assumed, at Stage 9. Decontam and dedup throughput (T10.4) are the second-order version: if they lag they become the true bottleneck.
7. **Reproducibility of a moving dataset.** Until T10.5's as-of watermark lands, "resume" reads a non-deterministic data order and eval numbers aren't comparable run-to-run.
8. **Eval-set drift.** Continuous generation grows val/test too; without T10.6's frozen snapshots, M1 and M3 PPL are measured on different token streams and can't be compared.
9. **Disk is the binding constraint (28GB) and the store only grows.** Compaction (T10.8) and curriculum-aware eviction (T10.9) are load-bearing, not optional — delete-after-consume alone does not bound a corpus that must stay a few steps ahead across six phases simultaneously.
